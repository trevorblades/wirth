      <h2>Our story</h2>
      <p>Jakob Wirth dreamed of creating a hat company. He envisioned something instantly recognizable; something stylish; something people would love to wear. For him, hats weren&apos;t just an accessory, they were a defining article of clothing, the perfect addition to an outfit, and a central part of what made you feel beautiful and unique.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately Jakob was never able to live out his dream, in 2014 Jakob took his life. At that time, 25 hats were made in Jakobs honour for his closest friends and family. This served as a way to help fulfill his dream and remind us that we are never as alone as we sometimes think we are.</p>
      <p>In 2017, classmate and friend of Jakob, Philipp Altenburg also took his life. Philipp had a dream for people to be open and communicate freely, yet he struggled to do so himself. The goal of Wirth Hats is simple, we want everyone in the world to know they are not alone, and we believe owning a Wirth Hat will help with that.</p>
